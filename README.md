# A Client / Server Demo wrote in TypeScript

[Watch a video](https://youtu.be/y3wjDTr7gsc)

## Using Node.js (Express) and React.

Run both server and client locally:
```
yarn dev
```

Run tests:
```
yarn test
```

# TO DO

- refactor client (pull out logic into services - it's a bit messy!)
- add tests to client components/services
- cache filter values on client (fetch them from a new endpoint)
- add sorting to client
- add pagination to client
